    "### Original Study Design\n",
    "The purpose of the original study was to measure spatial accessibility of healthcare resources, such as ICU beds and ventilators, for COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.\n",
    "According to Kang, \"Spatial accessibility was measured based on travel time between locations of residence and healthcare resources in the context of COVID-19 patients and population at risk (i.e., people aged over 50 years)\" (Kang et al., 2020).\n",
    "This was achieved through the use of an enhanced two-step flating catchment area (E2SFCA) method using a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS.\n",
    "E2SFCA first calculated a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location; afterwards it summed the ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlapped.\n",
    "However, given the fact that E2FSCA is very computationally intensive, a modified E2SFCA in order to conduct the study more efficiently, relying on Python multiprocessing library.\n",
    "The orignal study used four types of datasets: the study used a hospital dataset, which included the number of beds in ICUs and the number of ventilators per hospital; it used a dataset COVID-19 confirmed cases; it used a residential dataset; and it used a road network dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **spatial extent** of the study was Illinois, USA. The **spatial scale** of the study were zip codes. The **temporal extent** of the study was 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original study was conducted using CyberGIS-Jupyter. \n",

    "To perform the ESFCA method, three types of data are required, as follows: (1) road network, (2) population, and (3) hospital information. The road network can be obtained from the [OpenStreetMap Python Library, called OSMNX](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx). The population data is available on the [American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/deeplinks?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffactfinder.census.gov%2F&tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01). Lastly, hospital information is also publically available on the [Homelanad Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals?geometry=-94.504%2C40.632%2C-80.980%2C43.486)."

    "\n",
    "Function written by Joe Holler + Derrick Burt. It is a more efficient way to calculate distance-weighted catchment areas for each hospital. The algorithm runs quicker than the original one (\"calculate_catchment_area\"). It first creates a dictionary (with a node and its corresponding drive time from the hospital) of all nodes within a 30 minute drive time (using single_cource_dijkstra_path_length function). From here, two more dictionaries are constructed by querying the original one. From this dictionaries, single part convex hulls are created for each drive time interval and appended into a single list (one list with 3 polygon geometries). Within the list, the polygons are differenced from each other to produce three catchment areas.\n",
